Contains source code for Messages From the Universe Graveyard, an interactive fiction game originally made for [Shufflecomp 2023](https://itch.io/jam/shufflecomp-2023).

The game was made with <a href="https://github.com/zehanort/iffinity">iffinity</a>, an interactive fiction engine by Sotiris Niarchos.

Needed but not included in the repository due to being build outputs:

export/index.html
src/meta/crumblingcastle.js

Use `build` to generate them.

Assets aren't included in the repo since they'd make it unnecessarily large, but they come with the downloaded version of the game you can get on Itch.
