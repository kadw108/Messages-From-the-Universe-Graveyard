    <h3 class="roomName">Hall of Statues</h3>

    <p>On both sides of this corridor, overgrown statues sit in regularly placed alcoves, the features of each obscured by white flowers. Piles of waterlogged machinery lie neglected on the floor, some overgrown with white fuzz. The walls are covered in it.</p>

    <p>One alcove is populated by a <a class="whiteMarker marblePlaque" board="13">marble plaque</a>.</p>

    <p>Steps descend to a flooded intersection in the [[southwest|floodedHallIntersection]]. To the [[northeast|statueTowerStairwell]], the corridor opens into a stairwell.</p>
