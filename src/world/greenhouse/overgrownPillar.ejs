    <p>A broken pillar, covered in white vines, stands in the center of this room. Whatever it might have supported is no longer there. A <a class="whiteMarker marblePlaque" board="15">marble plaque</a> levitates above the remains of the pillar, rotating slowly.</p>

    <p>To the [[north|overgrownHallEast]], a stone door leads to an overgrown hallway.</p>
