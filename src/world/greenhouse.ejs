    <h3 class="roomName">Collapsed Hall</h3>

    <p>Puddles of water cover the floor. Small square windows, some cracked, are embedded into the walls at regular intervals. Wind howls through them, disturbing the mist. Outside you see white clouds tinged with a faint blue glow, refracted from the blue stone beneath you.</p>

    <p>One window is covered by a <a class="whiteMarker marblePlaque" board="0">marble plaque</a>.</p>

    <p>The hall runs [[north|pit]] and [[south|floodedHallNorth]].</p>

    <p>Water pours through holes in the ceiling, dripping down white flowers and white vines, pattering onto stone, flowing through long-worn crevices, before falling away through small cracks and holes threading through the floor. A <a class="whiteMarker marblePlaque" board="1">marble plaque</a> sits half-covered in vines.</p>

    <p>The hall runs [[north|floodedHallNorth]] and [[south|floodedHallSouth]]. To the [[northeast|hallOfStatues]], steps ascend to a corridor that looks to be in slightly better shape. A misty hallway intersects with this one to the [[west|overgrownHallEast]].</p>

    <p>The water falls with more ferocity, here. A miniature rainstorm contained in this one room. At the end of the hall is a sheer curtain of water, a waterfall crashing down with a deafening roar.

    <h3 class="roomName">Greenhouse - Entrance</h3>

    <p>This might have been a normal greenhouse once, but all the plants are covered by a thin layer of white fuzz. Their original colors can barely be discerned beneath the growth. White flowers sprout from other flowers, from the ceiling, from the walls. White vines lash together, stretching between plants and trees, like cobwebs. Unlike cobwebs, you can walk through them, feeling only a vague humidity as they dissolve at your touch and reform behind you.</p>

    <p>A <a class="whiteMarker marblePlaque" board="19">marble plaque</a> is nestled in the center of one flower, now overgrown with fuzz. The light here is a soft blue. From somewhere plays the distant trickle of water.</p>

    <p>A stone archway to the [[northeast|overgrownHallGraveyard]] leads to an overgrown hall. A path runs [[north|greenhouseNorth]] and [[south|greenhouseFountain]].</p>

    <p>A stone fountain, covered in white flowers, plays merrily in the center of this little plaza. Five benches surround it. On one sits a gleaming <a class="whiteMarker marblePlaque" board="20">marble plaque</a>. Crumpled robots lie in the white foliage, obscured mostly by white leaves.</p>

    <p>The path is too choked by vines here for you to continue. There is no way to go but back [[north|greenhouseEntrance]].</p>

    <p>Wind whistles through holes in the waterlogged ceiling. White flowers carpet the floor, curling their vines towards you.

    <p>One alcove is populated by a <a class="whiteMarker marblePlaque" board="13">marble plaque</a>.</p>
