    <p>A small cave of shining gold metal. It feels dangerously hot, a temperature that would burn you if you could burn.</p>

    <p>The <a class="panelOpener" identifier="machine">apparatus</a> in the center is wreathed with a frenzy of crackling embers that spark on the metal. Near it, an <button type="button" class="whiteMarker goldSphere" board="64">gold sphere</button> hovers.</p>

    <p>An exit to the [[east|moltenPumps]] leads to a hissing, crackling field of sulfur, with a bright line of fire on the horizon.</p>

    <p>Searing heat fills the air. Before you is an ocean of perpetual fire, incandescent. Instead of a sandy beach, the shore is a flat plain of hissing sulfur, glittering with red and gold embers. The ocean feeds into a conglomeration of machines, tubes and pipes harvesting a constant stream of red-hot liquid from the vehemently flaming tide.</p>

    <p>[[East|harvestMechanism2052A]] takes you along the shore, towards a bronze tower that vents occasional bursts of steam. To the [[south|brimstoneFields]], the rest of the beach is obscured by wavering heat and sparkling embers. To the [[west|obsidianGrotto]] is a small cave, set into towering golden cliffs that block off the rest of the shore.</p>

    <p>A multitude of pipes extend into the red ocean, pumping continuous fire into a mechanical tower adorned with various meters and dials. At the base of the tower, a network of even more pipes sprawl in various directions across the sulfur shore.</p>

    <p>An <button type="button" class="whiteMarker goldSphere" board="65">gold sphere</button> hovers over the red surf.</p>

    <p>You find an ocean of fire identical to the first, but facing south instead of north. Enormous rusted machines stand all around you, their pumps sluggish but still quite operational. Molten puddles of a glowing red-gold substance cover the ground. The <button type="button" class="whiteMarker goldSphere" board="66">gold sphere</button> floats above one such puddle.</p>

    <p>You can only go [[north|brimstoneFields]]; bulwarks of rusted machinery block any other path.</p>
