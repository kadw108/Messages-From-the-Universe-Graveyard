    <p>In the center of this room is a stretching rack, a contraption of wooden boards and rollers with chains and manacles dangling from its sides. The southern wall is occupied by an enormous weapons shelf full of knives, scalpels and other tools. Retractable metal hooks hang from the ceiling.</p>

    <p>A <button type="button" class="whiteMarker vellumScrap" board="75">scrap of vellum</button> lies on the floor.</p>

    <p>The only exit is [[west|dungeonCenter]].</p>

    <p>A pair of manacles is chained to the northern wall. Leaning against the opposite wall is an enormous wooden spoked wheel, with razors protruding from the rim. The floor is littered with crushed bone fragments and dried puddles of something dark and odorous.</p>

    <p>In the corner of the room, barely visible behind the wheel's rim, someone has scratched the number: 340.</p>

    <p>Someone has slid a <button type="button" class="whiteMarker vellumScrap" board="76">scrap of vellum</button> between two bricks in the wall.</p>

    <p>The only exit is [[east|dungeonCenter]].</p>

    <p>A cauldron occupies the center of this cell, an enormous iron vessel with a complex system of levers and pulleys suspended above. A niche in the eastern wall is filled with smaller pots and cauldrons of various shapes, some covered in waxy stains.</p>

    <p>The cauldron contains a <button type="button" class="whiteMarker vellumScrap" board="77">scrap of vellum</button>, and nothing more.</p>

    <p>The only exit is [[south|dungeonCenter]].</p>

    <p>A round brick chamber. The <a class="panelOpener" identifier="machine">apparatus</a> here is crafted of iron bars and chains, and encircled by a ring of red lanterns that tinge everything a deep scarlet. Three doorways, each with a spiked iron portcullis hanging above, lead [[north|dungeonNorth]], [[east|dungeonEast]], and [[west|dungeonWest]].</p>
