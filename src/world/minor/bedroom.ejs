    <p>A giant room. You cannot discern where it might end, or if it even has an end. Light shines from above, illuminating a vast assembly of floating beds, all perfectly made. Rich mahogany beds with thick velvet covers. Beds sized for children, bedazzled with pink and blue sequins. Skinny hospital beds, soggy mold-covered mattresses, sleeping bags, a <a class="whiteMarker" board="78">bed covered in writing</a>, and more...</p>

    <p>The <a class="panelOpener" identifier="machine">apparatus</a> lies under a rustic wooden bed with navy bedsheets, adorned with embroidered anchors and ships.</p>

    <p>You can travel [[further|bedroom1]] from the apparatus.</p>
