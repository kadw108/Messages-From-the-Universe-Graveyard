    <p>Enormous yellow ferns curl out of the ground and arch together. Under them, metallic arms intertwine into a cage-like <a class="panelOpener" identifier="machine">apparatus</a>, covered in dark draping vines.</p>

    <p>The grass below is a shade of green so bright it almost looks gold. A gray <a class="whiteMarker stoneStele" board="36">stone stele</a> pokes through. Scattered around it are scraps of metal, screws and hinges half-covered by dirt and dew.</p>

    <p>The undergrowth is thick enough to block most paths through the forest. You can move [[north|fallenSaint]], [[northeast|878Altar]], and [[south|343Altar]].</p>

    <h3 class="roomName">878's Altar</h3>

    <p>Yellow ferns many time your height shiver in a breeze redolent with the fresh scent of saffron. The pillar that spears through the center of this grove is engraved with a language you don't understand. It hums at a pitch resonant with your bones, shivering into the core of you. The <a class="whiteMarker stoneStele" board="37">stone stele</a> by the pillar's side is minuscule in comparison.</p>

    <p>The undergrowth here is thick enough to block most paths through the forest. You can move [[northwest|emptyThrones]], [[southwest|skyGrove]], and [[west|fallenSaint]].</p>

    <h3 class="roomName">343's Altar</h3>

    <p>A rectangle of stone on the ground, now overgrown with golden moss, indicates the place where a building once stood. In the rectangle's center, a black monolith is covered with inscriptions you cannot make out in the dim lighting. Four candles, placed equidistant from the monolith, flicker erratically. Lush flowering vines cover the bottoms of the candles and the <a class="whiteMarker stoneStele" board="38">stone stele</a> nearby.</p>

    <p>Thick curtains of hanging vines block all paths but the way back [[north|skyGrove]], and a small space to the [[south|shatteredPath]] where you can squeeze through the foliage.</p>

    <p>A stone wall surrounds the bottom half of an enormous stone statue, its top half sheared clean off. Dark vines, dotted with golden flowers, crawl over the statue and a neighboring <a class="whiteMarker stoneStele" board="39">stone stele</a>. Three sides of the wall have been eroded down to knee-height, with an overgrown doorway in the remaining side leading [[northwest|windPrayer]] to a more intact room that stands despite the ravages of time.</p>

    <p>The vegetation grows sparser to the [[north|emptyThrones]]. Paths through the undergrowth cut [[east|878Altar]] and [[south|skyGrove]].</p>

    <p>Within the darkness of this room you distinguish a multitude of paper scrolls, all blank, hanging from the stone walls and the partially collapsed ceiling. Wind blows through holes from above, and the scrolls sway in the breeze. Flecks of gold pollen swirl. A <a class="whiteMarker stoneStele" board="40">stone stele</a> is placed unobtrusively in the corner.</p>

    <p>The only exit is a doorway in the [[southeast|fallenSaint]], half-concealed behind a blanket of yellow-green leaves.</p>

    <p>This grove is filled with concentric rings of stone pedestals, some crumbling, most in surprisingly pristine condition. Each pedestal is empty. In the center of all the rings, a <a class="whiteMarker stoneStele" board="41">stone stele</a> hovers.</p>

    <p>To the [[north|108Altar]], the vegetation thins until it vanishes entirely. Paths lead [[south|fallenSaint]] and [[southeast|878Altar]] through the forest.</p>

    <p>The ferns part here, revealing a sheer cliff that drops into swirling gray mist. A thicket of vines near the edge prevents you from falling. Before it is a simple stone fountain, clear water rippling in its basin, and a <a class="whiteMarker stoneStele" board="42">stone stele</a> hovering directly above. Yellow flowers grow around it.</p>

    <p>[[South|emptyThrones]] takes you back into the forest.</p>

    <p>The ferns part here, revealing a sheer cliff beneath a roseate sky streaked with gold. All around, the wind howls. Small snowflakes flurry down around you, mingled with specks of yellow pollen. You feel no cold.</p>

    <p>The remnants of a bridge stretch into the air. Only a few feet of the bridge remain. Looking down beneath the wooden slats reveals several cracked supports pillars, then nothing. A <a class="whiteMarker stoneStele" board="43">stone stele</a> hovers above the empty air left behind by the cracked supports, thankfully still within reach.</p>

    <p>The forest thickens to the [[north|343Altar]].</p>
