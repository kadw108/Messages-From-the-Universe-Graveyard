    <h3>To Play</h3>

    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>This game lets you communicate with other players. In many places, you can leave anonymous messages for people to see.</p>

    <p>The game has at least 20k words. I estimate it'd take at least two hours to see everything, but feel free to duck in for a few minutes and then leave. Ideally the landscape will change over time as more messages pop out, so you can check back regularly for new stuff. Assuming nothing breaks.</p>

    <p>The game doesn&#39;t really have an ending. If you want, you can consider exploring every room and messageboard in the game to be the ending. There&#39;s a few secrets hidden here and there. A list of all the teleport codes is included near the end of this page, if you don't feel like figuring things out yourself.</p>

    <div class="linkReplacer hidden" identifier="messageSystem">
      <h4 class="linkHider" identifier="messageSystem">▼ The Message System</h4>

      <p>The most experimental part of the game. Don't know for sure how the servers will do, so there may be bugs. If you can't see/send messages, the game is broken.</p>

      <p>Generally, say whatever you want as long as it&#39;s not hate speech or illegal. Leave as many messages as you want. I'll delete truly horrible messages, but remain hands-off for the most part. Go ham.</p>

        Made for
        <a class="outsideLink" href="https://itch.io/jam/shufflecomp-2023">Shufflecomp 2023/2024</a>
        in slightly less than three weeks. Used another project as a template from my other projects, so it wasn&#39;t entirely made from scratch in three weeks, but most of it was. (You can probably guess how I spent my holiday season.) Used zehanort&#39;s
        <a class="outsideLink" href="https://github.com/zehanort/iffinity">iffinity</a>, something like Twine but more involved on the coding side.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Shufflecomp you submit eight songs and are given eight songs from eight other randomly selected participants, then make a game based on at least one of the songs. I used
        <a class="outsideLink" href="https://youtu.be/qrP5IClb6b8">Bad Moon Rising</a>, a song about the apocalypse, and <a class="outsideLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLP8rFrL1W0">Crumbling Castle</a>, a song about hiding in a crumbling castle during the apocalypse. Evidently I am a fan of the apocalypse. There&#39;s a few references to other songs I got, but mostly it's those two.

        <ul>
          <li><a class="outsideLink" href="https://youtu.be/qrP5IClb6b8">Bad Moon Rising - Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>: The game involves a network of dead worlds connected to each other. Some of the message-senders who came before you are from an alternate Earth (or Earths) where the world has ended.</li>

          <li><a class="outsideLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLP8rFrL1W0">King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - Crumbling Castle</a> - Multiple castles in this game, from the name of the in-story game to some of the areas you can visit. The general concept of hiding in a bunker playing video games while the world ends outside. The song is used on the game&#39;s title screen, but only because it happens to be public domain, so that probably shouldn&#39;t count.</li>

          <li><a class="outsideLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJeG-GGH114">Akbar - Jeffrey Dallas</a> - There is a corn. There is a character who befriends the corn. For a certain definition of befriend. Unlike in the song, the corn survives this one.</li>

          <li><a class="outsideLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ug1nNkm97o">No More Hot Dogs by Hasil Adkins</a> - Would have added more hot dog references if I could. Hope there are enough murder references to satisfy fans of this song.</li>

          <li><a class="outsideLink" href="https://confidencemantm.bandcamp.com/track/c-o-o-l-party">Confidence Man - C.O.O.L Party</a> - One character is obsessed with parties. Does it count?</li>

          <li><a class="outsideLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obox1Jwn6UA">Body of Desire - October</a> - As far as a general lack of motivation to live goes, examples aren't difficult to find here. Found it hard to include more specific references.</li>

          <li><a class="outsideLink" href="https://ladytron.bandcamp.com/track/destroy-everything-you-touch-2">Destroy Everything You Touch - Ladytron</a> and <a class="outsideLink" href="https://youtu.be/Ty_wKbvYo-s?si=2IjIFaHWmojICi0g">Wake Up - Sion, SOULBYSEL</a> Had a hard time incorporating these two. A few messages might be references if you squint.</li>

You also need to enter numbers to access different teleporters. Never beat this game, but there's a neat

Took inspiration for the dorm area from here. Also, the description of the node teleport was stolen wholesale from catherine's portals. Sorry, catherine.</li>
        <li><a class="outsideLink" href="https://thebeginnersgui.de/">The Beginner's Guide</a>, specifically the <a class="outsideLink" href="https://the-beginners-guide.fandom.com/wiki/Notes">Notes game</a> where you walk through a 3D environment full of notes supposedly left by other people. You soon learn that every note was actually left by the developer, a single person masquerading as a whole world of players. The Beginner's Guide is great and I highly recommend it (even if you don't buy it, go watch a playthrough on Youtube like I did, there's a million of them).</li>

          I put the
          <a class="outsideLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4dGpz6cnHo">Backrooms</a> in this game because I could. The playground area is a ripoff of liminal playground concepts, including &quot;Level FUN&quot;. It's also heavily inspired by "<a class="outsideLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8U22dvli4w">PLAYGROUND - trailer</a>", an incredible trailer for a (currently still in development) animated horror series set in a seemingly neverending playground. Seriously go watch it, it's very cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          The pine grove area is heavily inspired by the outskirts of Redacre from The Blackout Club. Specifically the
          <a class="outsideLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEJGw1oWUsI">end-of-prologue area.</a>
          Interesting game where the devs could hijack NPC interactions and talk directly to the players, leading to a lot of fun dialogue.

          Greenhouse is inspired by
