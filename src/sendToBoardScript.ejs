Honestly.)\n\nHell, characters don't really exist anymore. Just having a name was hard enough to get working again. Identities, far as I could configure them, are anonymous and temporary. More's the pity!\n\nWhy am I doing this? I'm fond of old games, I guess. Not much else to do while we're all stuck here, you know? \n\nDoesn't really bear thinking on.

Most of the usual sites have been going down anyway.\n\nCitadel Universe: a federated-server VR^2 MMORPG. It wasn't your typical MMORPG and had a number of new and unique features, which probably why it shut down. People hate anything original. (Also, users had trouble with the VR^2 part. But it was probably because people hate anything original and Citadel Universe was just too good for this world. Not that I'm biased or anything.)\n\nSince the servers were federated, users kept the network running.

There's also multiversal drift, where parts of the citadel steadily get further and further away from each other (probably analogous for universal expansion). This explains why a lot of connections are broken, and why most people congregate around certain areas in a supposedly infinite space. But it was more of an in-universe explanation for a lot of the servers giving up the ghost/stuff breaking as real life got in the way and they lost money etc.\n\nI'm being vague because I couldn't find much on this, really.

If you ran out of energy, you died forever. I removed that feature (you can thank me later) because otherwise you'd die very quickly, given most of the systems for generating food no longer exist. So much doesn't work anymore.\n\nNot only did I tweak the config so you can't die of hunger, you actually can't die at all. So don't worry about death pits or anything.

Better not forget it.)\n\nBy the way, there's a filter on swears here. Though you can get past it pretty easily by just putting stuff around the words, so I don't know why they bothered.\n\nBe good people, okay?

The archaeologist said the statues here were built this way, storing rain in hidden crevices in their skulls so they could weep even after the sky clears. I wonder at these landmarks.

It was my folly; I misled the merciful king Zanzibar into believing I could retrieve the chalice of godsblood from that pernicious tribe of heathens to the west. It is a grail wrought of half silver, half gold, into which the holy blood of the First Pilgrim was poured upon His slaughter. I failed to obtain it. The merciful king Zanzibar has provided a stay of execution, but he has also decreed that for a hundred years and one I may not return to my homeland.\n\nThe citadel is my answer, my prayer. Here, time can take strange shapes, tracing new paths across the citadel without center. It is said that in distant realms here you do not age, that the flesh of monsters and the blood of daemons slaughtered on holy ground can sustain you for years beyond human ken.

From a former slave who lived five hundred dream-years in the service of an hypnogaegic emperor I learned the art of metalworking and built a boat to sail the river of stars. Down the river I saw much. Kingdoms of things that were not human, not flesh, but still lived. but still alive. Innumerable fallen kingdoms. The rain fell upon their monuments and eroded them to nothing. I saw my past and my future, many times over. I saw the true meaninglessness of my own life. I am like a speck of dust within a speck and everything I write is worthless. Soon these tablets, too, will be eroded.\n\nI wonder if I will get anywhere. Perhaps my journey has no true destination.

A second can pass for you while your family and friends age a hundred years. To enter is to become untethered from reality.\n\nThese altars are built to gods; the people here fear the wrath of gods.

And the townspeople, overwhelmed by the revelation that they have been living their lives in the false light of a false sun, would give in to despair and die.\n\nIt is odd.

I see nothing of value here.'}, {'author': 'Chemist', 'name': 'hiddenGrove', 'message': "The others are flagging. Surveyor said mapping this place is impossible.

Says they correspond to no known branches of science. Get him going and he raves about the implications, bubble nucleation and false vacuum collapse, waves and radiation.\n\nWonder how far this expedition will go. Surely we will collect enough data, after a point. Surely we must turn back, eventually. For now we continue through the infinite citadel with no beginning or end. We pass a sunbleached valley of bones and a sunkissed valley of orchids.

Went on a rant about all the instruments he's been bringing along, the experiments he performs every night when we set up camp. Makes no sense, he said. Basic laws are being violated.

Neither have returned yet."}, {'author': 'Chemist', 'name': 'cellWest', 'message': 'Tired. Even as I write this my eyes closed. The physicist found what he wanted. Locked himself in one of these rooms and did not come out. Vowed not to until he had solved the problem he had fixated on, which the locals said was impossible.

Their quest is futile. I have fixed these words on my forehead and bound them as signs on my hands and scrawled them on every surface, but they are blind to the truth. They will not acknowledge me. They see in me a blind and pitiable thing, a follower strayed from the path. They do not understand that I am their future.

Always.\n\nSo we're trapped waiting for the canned food to run out. Figure most people are in a similar situation. The number of truly self-sufficient bunkers when you get to it are few and far between. God knows how many people crawled into half-built vaults and withered away from radiation poisoning.

Twice the size of ours, but they need it.\n\nThe maintenance passages have been closed, so we're limited just to our own bunker. No delving through the tunnels.\n\nI'm the youngest here, discounting Shawn's three kids. Thin dude, dark hair and glasses. His wife Jessica looks similar minus the glasses. Also longer curlier hair and an 80s housewife smile. Not in a bad way. I've seen worse.\n\nThe kids mostly keep to themselves. Sometimes I'll catch them wandering around, but usually Jessica's with them. Sometimes they're in the common room playing with toys. They don't have many. Figures. No one expected the bombs to drop this early.\n\nIvory's boyfriend is a total recluse. Would doubt he was even real but sometimes he hangs around the kitchen at night, sucking coffee from an old mug like he's on death row. Tall Asian guy, muscular, intimidating as all hell. Still haven't caught his name."}, {'author': 'Zachbar', 'name': 'whiteWormbed', 'message': "[DATE_INFO_CORRUPT]\n\nAll night Ivory keeps VRing in the common area.

Then threatened to sic her boyfriend on me. So I gave up."}, {'author': 'Zachbar', 'name': 'glassTowerStairwell', 'message': "[DATE_INFO_CORRUPT]\n\nFinally talked to Ivory's boyfriend. More chill than I expected. His name is Jae. Turns out his parents owned this bunker but couldn't make it in. It was supposed to be for their family and now it's filled with randoms.\n\nHe's taking everything better than I would, all things considered. Showed me around a bit, explained how the VR set works. Apparently used to be a VR tech, that's how they have it here. I got to see a few apps, including Ivory's chat connector. He said turning down the volume wasn't an option, but I'll take what I can get.\n\nThey even have WoT on there. We played a round and he kicked my ass."}, {'author': 'Zachbar', 'name': 'diningHall', 'message': "[DATE_INFO_CORRUPT]\n\nShawn used to be a manager at some power plant. Makes sense. He has the manager look. Or some kind of schoolteacher. Like he'd slap you with a ruler if you could. But he's nicer than that.\n\nTonight he baked a pie. Cherry. We shared it around the kitchen table, all nine of us. Shawn and his family, me and my grandma, Jae and Ivory. Cutting it was a pain since there's no knives. Shawn said they were probably removed for safety reasons. His kids are pretty cute. Bella, the youngest one, was pretending her pieces of pie were little planes. Classic move.\n\nIt's easy to lose hope here, since we don't know when the doors will open. But nights like this I think everything will be okay. Maybe we'll live.\n\n---"}, {'author': 'Zachbar', 'name': 'bathhouseDeepWater', 'message': "[DATE_INFO_CORRUPT]\n\nLights were flickering a bit yesterday. Can't be a good sign.

Air filtration's the biggest risk if it malfunctions. Could let in all kinds of gases you don't want. When oxygen levels get low it incites irrational behavior. \n\nAlso showed us how to work the coffee machine.

I'll be sneaking in VR minutes and she appears saying: give me the interface plugs please, I was gonna go to a party you know, VR party, party of the year, blah blah blah and it wears on me so I toss her the plugs and say do whatever.\n\nIvory's the only one enjoying herself here. All the time she's chatting it up with her invisible friends. Dancing with people who aren't there. Her party exists only virtually, but that's enough for her. For someone with a boyfriend she barely talks to him.\n\nSince I can't be on while she is I just stare at things instead. Cans of food in the storage room. Trash chute. Laundry machine.

Things we live or die by, now."}, {'author': 'Zachbar', 'name': 'onTheLadder', 'message': "[DATE_INFO_CORRUPT]\n\nHad another dinner last night. Gram made chili. Shawn and Jessica baked two pies. Cherry again, and apple. Both small on their own, but together it was enough to split among all of us and then save leftovers. Almost felt like we weren't buried underground but at a special potluck.

If this is true, could there be a way to "hack" the simulation? Or to move our bodies from one part of the simulation to another? No universe has enough resources to simulate a complete universe inside itself, so our universe is necessarily incomplete. It only feels complete to us because we cannot perceive the entire universe at a time and thus see the shortcuts being taken with rendering. But, perhaps we could convince the master computer our universe is running on to move its resources to another universe - such as the universe-within-a-universe that is the Citadel Universe.\n\nThe human consciousness is just a pattern of electrical signals within the brain. These signals are crucial to the master computer simulating the universe because they\'re what it scans to determine what we\'re perceiving and therefore what to render. They are \'us\' more than we are our brains or bodies. The key to \'consciousness transfer\' is simply to create a replica of those signals that is faithful enough to your original signals that the master computer becomes confused about which one is the real \'you\', and that\'s your Citadel Universe avatar.

All moments exist simultaneously. Thus as your brain shuts down during death, a version of your consciousness will be frozen in its last moment of existence, most likely in extreme agony.

Her patients were old. Fragments of her official duties passed to me as snippets of medical terms: edema, lymphedema, occasionally the bits I could recognize - heart attack, major organ failure. I imagined her patients dying on stretchers, bathed in the blue emergency lights from the ambulance, which recurred in my dreams though I'd never seen the real thing.\n\nWe spoke little. I heard the garage door grinding open, her car pulled in while clouds of motor dust settled into the corners. I laid on my bed hearing the door slam down again. I spent nights in my room watching the streetlights outside flicker in syncopation. Rows of teeming houses spilling onto the streets, then rising beyond to carve out some strange lines whiose meaning I could never discern, a symbol written for me alone that I found nonetheless indecipherable. In daylight these halogen dreams were forgotten and I dawdled my way through school to dream at night once more of those sickly patients strapped to their hospital beds, limbs askew. Varicose veins winding past their skin, papery, the stench of UTIs, some other medical terms, and they phased past me while I fell asleep.\n\nI would imagine myself dead, too, lying on that bed in a house of dust.
